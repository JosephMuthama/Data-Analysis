Analysis is based on customers churning in telecom network,Utilize customer-level data to predict high-risk churn customers, aiming to reduce customer attrition within telecom services 

The insights we have gained into the churn data set through the use of exploratory data analysis:
The four charge fields are linear functions of the minute fields.
Customers with the International Plan tend to churn more frequently.
Customers with four or more customer service calls churn more than four times as often as do the other customers.
Customers with high day minutes and evening minutes tend to churn at a higher rate than do the other customers.
